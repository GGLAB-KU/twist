<h3>Usage</h3>
- Change the path of the json file (translation dump) and run the code.  
- It will generate two files: **dump2links.log**, **dump2links.csv**.
The csv file contains the data we need.
- You can see the timer and which operations are done in the terminal.
- The API will answer 5000 requests per hour at most.

<h3>TODO</h3>
- Change timer format to HH:MM:SS.  
- Add code output the pageid in a third column.  
- Add code to get a list of pageid's and get info from API to put their 
headers in a seperate column. (This will make it easier to seperate them
as scientific or non-scientific)
